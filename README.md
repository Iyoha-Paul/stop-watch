### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```SASS
{@function set-test-color($color) {
  @if (lightness($color) > 40%) {
    @return #000;
  } @else {
    @return white;
  }
}}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = function startTimercode() {
  sec++;
  // console.log('working');
  if (min > 59) {
    hr++;
    min = 0;
  }

  min = sec > 59 ? min + 1 : min;

  sec = sec > 59 ? 0 : sec;
  let hrTag = hr > 9 ? "" : 0;
  let minTag = min > 9 ? "" : 0;
  let secTag = sec > 9 ? "" : 0;
  stopWatchScreen.textContent = `${hrTag}${hr}:${minTag}${min}:${secTag}${sec}`;
  timerIsCounting = true;
};
```

### Continued development

more lessons on Javascript!

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me so learn about SetInterval() function reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
